# RCcar

# Current Notes and Next Steps:
I will be fleshing out the conceptual goals and making a conceptual HLD for both the firmware and hardware



# What Does Success Look Like?

A remote controlled car, this will be fleshed out in goals and requirements

# Focus:
A focus for this project is on project management, as I will be using Notion to track tasks, priorities, 
and dependencies, and the engineering design cycle, as I will be planning, researching, designing, consulting with peers and mentors, 
and iterating as necessary to complete this project. 

I will be roughly following a stage gate process while trying to incorporate agile techniques. 

This will be a multidisciplinary project.
However as I am an electrical engineering student, hardware and firmware will be the focus of my work.


# What Will be Documented Here:
In this repo, I will be:
- documenting sources and tracking research;
- version control for the solidworks files, KiCad/Altium files, and relavent code files;
- posting finalized documents such as weighted objectives charts, and decisions evaluation matrices;
- and crediting my collaborators

# List of Collaborators:
## Andrew
- helped define project scope


# Goals and requirements:
- Wireless control
- Can move forwards and backwards 
- Can turn in motion
- Battery powered
- Modular and re-usable code




# Expanding the scope:
## Battery Charger for the Main Car Battery: 
- must be compatible with wall NA outlets
- will require additional research into batteries
- Battery chargers/wall outlet safety(initial research prompts):
	- Things to keep in mind:
	- WALL OUTLETS ARE DANGEROUS(TALK TO ELECTRICIAN/MORE EXPERIENCED PERSON BEFORE DOING ANYTHING)
	- Some rectifier
	- How to lower the voltage
## Use Microcontroller STM32:
- I have an STM32 F303RE, so can use that for prototyping.
## Do Pre-Programmed Missions:
- Store mission on sd card, will need to look into how do this
## Low Power Mode to Turn On and Off the Car Using the Remote
