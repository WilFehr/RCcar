# RCcar

# Notes:

the initial research document is in google docs and will be uploaded here as a PDF once finished, currently I've noticed that if I want more electrical freedom, I will need to be more involved on the mech side which is part of the delay on that front

I am currently in a project based class, so a lot of my project work time is going into that, this will delay the updates here, feel free to check out my ECE299 repo for the updates on that project.


# What Does Success Look Like?

A remote controlled car

# Focus:
The focus of this project is on project management, as I will be using Notion to track tasks, priorities, 
and dependencies, and the engineering design cycle, as I will be planning, researching, designing, consulting with peers and mentors, 
and iterating as necessary to complete this project.

This will be a multidisciplinary project, 
However as I am an electrical engineering student that will be the focus of my work, 
and I may opt for a more practical solution when it comes to design implementation and choose premade components or reference existing libraries, 
as the physical construction and the software are not the priorities of this project.

# Next Step:
This project is currently in the initial research phase and will remain so until I have finalized the puzzle room project.

# What Will be Documented Here:
In this repo, I will be:
- documenting sources and tracking research;
- version control for the solidworks files, KiCad files, and relavent code files;
- posting finalized documents such as weighted objectives charts, and decisions evaluation matrices;
- and crediting my collaborators

# List of Collaborators:
## Andrew
- helped define project scope


# Goals:
- Wireless control
- Controlled using external hard ware
- Drives straight when directed to do so
- Can turn in motion
- Mostly 3d printed
- Battery powered


# Wants:
- Main microcontroller to be the ATMega328P,(can use arduino for testing)
- Be able to live read data such as speed, distance travelled, orientation(has it flipped over), [more?]




# Expanding the scope:
## Battery Charger for the Main Car Battery: 
- must be compatible with wall NA outlets
- will require additional research into batteries
- Battery chargers/wall outlet safety(initial research prompts):
	- Things to keep in mind:
	- WALL OUTLETS ARE DANGEROUS(TALK TO ELECTRICIAN/MORE EXPERIENCED PERSON BEFORE DOING ANYTHING)
	- Some rectifier
	- How to lower the voltage
## Use Microcontroller STM32:
- I have an STM32 F303RE, so can use that for prototyping.
## Do Pre-Programmed Missions:
- Store mission on sd card, will need to look into how do this
## Low Power Mode to Turn On and Off the Car Using the Remote
